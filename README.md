# Uffda Web Application

# What is it
The Uffda Web Application is a database management tool meant to be used by database administrators
to manage for a community-driven recreation service. It was created by a team of two CS students from
Oregon State's Computer Science Program.
Our database holds information related to available activities, locations for activities, volunteers, 
participants, age groups for different activies and an entity table holding information regarding all
enrollments.
